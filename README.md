# Face-Recognition-using-GUI

A GUI model which detects face of a person from photo as well as live that is from primary camera.
You just need to upload the images in the same folder or give path of image so that faces from image will be detected.

I have uploaded both files .py as well as .ipynb for convinience and also uploaded some sample images for try.
Try it! Very Interesting!!
